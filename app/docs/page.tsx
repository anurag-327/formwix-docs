          <p className="mb-4">
            Formwix is a configuration-driven form builder for React
            applications, built on top of React Hook Form and Zod. It allows you
            to define forms using a single configuration object, specifying
            fields, validation rules, and behavior without repetitive
            boilerplate code. Formwix is uncontrolled and performant, ensuring
            high performance with minimal re-renders and full TypeScript
            support.

          Formwix is not just another form libraryâ€”it&apos;s a complete form
          management system.

        <p className="leading-[1.65rem] [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Most form libraries provide pre-built components, but customizing them
          to fit your design system or adding new field types often requires
          extra effort. You might end up wrapping components, overriding styles,
          or combining multiple libraries with incompatible APIs.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[1.65rem] [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Formwix simplifies form creation by allowing you to define forms using
          configurations instead of manually wiring up components. It also
          provides built-in theming support, enabling seamless styling while
          maintaining flexibility.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-[1.65rem] [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          By reducing boilerplate and offering full customization, Formwix helps
          developers build complex forms faster without compromising on control
          or design.
